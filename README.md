#Static Comp Challenge #1

##Overview & Goals
This mod1 solo project is focused on recreating a static comp.
The goal is to practice wireframing, pseudocoding, semantic HTML naming, and CSS tools such as Grid and Flexbox. The layout will need to work across Safari, Chrome, and Firefox. It will also need to use normalize or reset file in CSS. While I will employ creative liberties, the structural integrity of the comp must remain.

The project is due Monday, May 25th at 10pm.

The estimated timeline is as follows:
- Wireframing completed by Wednesday pm
- Crude HTML/CSS rendered by Thursday pm
- Responsive implementation
- Polishing until Monday deadline!

##Set-up
- Fork the repo on Github and clone it down into terminal.
- Open your local repository in your preferred editor and begin with the ReadMe.

##Progression
**5/20/2020 Planning Day**
I created a new repo and cloned it down. I set up the readme, readme-images and assets folders, and html and css files.

**5/21/2020 Styling**
I added crafted HTML and CSS styling for my Space Force Mission Control page. In the header, I added a navigation section of 3 buttons for the Mission Control page, Classified page, and US Space Force home page. I also added a logo of Space Force and an account button on the right side. In the main section, I made 8 cards representing "missions" the user could choose. These missions displayed a still photo of a potential video that could be accessed by the play button, and mission information. I added a starry background, which contrasted well with the purple/teal glow shadow effect on many of my elements.

I do not have adequate nor quality responsiveness yet.

**5/20/2020**
I added media query to CSS to respond at 500px.
I changed the  nav buttons to stack on top of each other when the screen is smaller.
