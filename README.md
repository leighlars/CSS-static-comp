#Static Comp Challenge #1
Leigh Larson (https://github.com/leighlars)

##Overview & Goals
This mod1 solo project is focused on recreating a static comp.
The goal is to practice wireframing, pseudocoding, semantic HTML naming, and CSS tools like Grid and Flexbox. The layout will need to work across Safari, Chrome, and Firefox. It will also need to use normalize or reset file in CSS. While I will employ creative liberties, the structural integrity of the comp must remain.

The project is due Monday, May 25th at 10pm.

The estimated timeline is as follows:
- Wireframing completed by Wednesday pm
- Crude HTML/CSS rendered by Thursday pm
- Responsive implementation
- Polishing until Monday deadline!

##Progression
**5/20/2020 Planning Day**
I created a new repo and cloned it down. I set up the readme, readme-images and assets folders, and html and css files.
